Tasks to integrate material design 
----------------------------------

1. Separate wrapper and views 
2. Find the right way to display menu.
3. Think on a way to show why material design is needed 



For packing:

1. Display a list of boxes 
2. in each box -  on click, show the content 
3. design the content view
4. enable adding boxes.



Ideas 
views should include the md-content or maybe also the menu md-sidenav or md-bottom-nav

there are 2 implementations of material-design
bootstrap-material-design
angular-material

angualr-material is missing basic elements such as tool bar. 


Can be combine the two?
